# More about me
* Hello, my name in Chinese is 金鑫, grown up at Chengdu, a culturally diverse, inclusive and beautiful city.
* I was sent to learn violin as a child. I am still strugling with pitch's accuracy after so many years.
* When at undergraduate, I was a member of the university's high-level orchestra. And also play bands a bit(I floated between different bands as a keyboard player, and did not stay at a stable one). 
* I often rent a digital piano in my student dormitory so I don't disturb others. But it has to be said that a mechanical piano can better express the layers and intensity control of the music.
* I like to analyze and discuss the **composition of a piece of music**
* Becausse I can play/listen the music in my brain, actually I do not often listen to music by ear in comparison with most music enthusiast in my daily time. I often read music sheet to appreciate the music instead. Another reason is that when I was at orchestra/band/preparing music performances, my ear suffered a lot :) so that my brain/ear are sensitive to listening too much. I like music, but I appreciate the peace and quiet more.
* When I was around 15, my favourtie movie was 3 Idiots. Now my favourite movie is **Dead Poet Society**
