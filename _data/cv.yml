    - title: A BSR-CSR dynamic sparse storage format For Sparse matrix with dense submatrix
      institution: The article suggests a BSR-CSR dynamic block hybrid storage approach for sparse matrix with dense sub-matrices multiplication to improve the operation continuity, and space of sparse matrix multiplication with dense sub-matrices in the calculation process. The purpose of this article is to devise a method for heuristically locating the dense sub-matrices in a sparse matrix. Finding and dividing dense submatrices reasonably into blocks can reduce the frequency of memory visits for sparse matrices that have dense submatrices. The concept of BSR dynamic partitioning matrix is put forth, in order to avoid multiple access to shared memory for a complete row or column caused by discontinuous access. And to equitably allocate the length of shared memory, this concept dynamically allocates the shared memory according to the size of partitioning matrix.

    - title: An application and innovation of Clustering in the investment of Broken net shares
      institution: Collective bidding directly influences stock price. Earnings, news, market mood, monetary policy, and public opinion all influence buying and selling. Evaluating events and determining their timeliness is highly challenging. Certain facts may still be reflected in fundamental conditions. The purpose of this article is to investigate the common traits and guidelines of the fundamentals in historical data. The A-share market sotck is more prone to be net-value broken than other global markets. This study examines the rationality, stability, and fair expectationof long-term profitability, for stock selection based on price-to-book ratios<1. 3,727 A-share mainland sotcks are used
